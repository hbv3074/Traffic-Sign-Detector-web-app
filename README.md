# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs using deep learning and computer vision. It leverages a CNN model trained on traffic sign datasets to classify and identify different road signs.

## ✨ Features
✅ Traffic Sign Classification using CNN  
✅ Real-time Detection with OpenCV  
✅ Flask Web Interface for user interaction  
✅ Data Augmentation for better model performance  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Model training and prediction  
- **OpenCV** – Image preprocessing and real-time recognition  
- **Flask** – Web application for user interaction  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling and processing  

## 📂 Project Structure
```
app.py                      # Flask web application
main.py                     # Model training script
test.py                     # Webcam-based testing
labels.csv                  # Traffic sign classification labels
model.h5                    # Trained deep learning model
Traffic_Sign_Recognition.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook for experimentation
```

## 🚀 Workflow
1️⃣ Preprocess the dataset (grayscale, histogram equalization, normalization)  
2️⃣ Train the CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras  
3️⃣ Validate and fine-tune the model for higher accuracy  
4️⃣ Deploy the model with Flask for real-time predictions  

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve real-time accuracy with better augmentation  
🔹 Deploy as a mobile or edge device application  
🔹 Integrate with autonomous driving systems
