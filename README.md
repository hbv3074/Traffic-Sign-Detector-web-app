# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on recognizing **traffic signs** using **deep learning** and **computer vision**. It leverages a **CNN model** trained on traffic sign datasets to classify and identify different road signs.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Traffic Sign Classification** using CNN  
✅ **Real-time Detection** with OpenCV  
✅ **Flask Web Interface** for user interaction  
✅ **Data Augmentation** for better model performance  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Model training and prediction  
- **OpenCV** – Image preprocessing and real-time recognition  
- **Flask** – Web application for user interaction  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling and processing

## 🚀 Workflow  
1️⃣ **Preprocess the dataset** (grayscale, histogram equalization, normalization)  
2️⃣ **Train the CNN model** using TensorFlow/Keras  
3️⃣ **Validate and fine-tune** the model for higher accuracy  
4️⃣ **Deploy the model** with Flask for real-time predictions
